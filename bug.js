This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` component with a custom `onBarCodeScanned` function.  The `onBarCodeScanned` function receives barcode data, but if the barcode is scanned rapidly multiple times, the `onBarCodeScanned` function may not fire for every subsequent scan.  This can lead to some barcodes being missed entirely, resulting in incorrect or incomplete data processing. The issue is further complicated if the scanning rate is higher than the processing speed of the application.
